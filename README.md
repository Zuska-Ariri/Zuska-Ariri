- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zuska-Ariri
- 👀 I’m interested in developing automatic services that fasten and ease the processes businesses need & developing visual representation of complex statistics information.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, R and HTML. I have experience on JMP (JSL), Power Bi (DAX) & RStudio. In statistics software, besides JMP I have also used InfoStat, Stata and Minitab.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that could start a business.
